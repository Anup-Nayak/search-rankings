 Congress does not foolishly accept the two nation theory, there will be only one Congress in the whole country. The partition of India does not and should not mean the partition of the Congress. The partition of India into two sovereign States does not mean that India is two nations. Sup posing one or more Princely States kept out of the Union, would the Congress turn their representatives out of the Congress ? Would the States people not expect it to take even greater interest in their welfare ? Of course the problems that this will create will be even more complicated and some of them will be more difficult of solution, but there still will be no reason for the Congress to be broken up into two. It will require greater political acumen, greater depth of thought and much more patient deliberation and decision. We must not anticipate incapacitating difficulties.
