 1 In his broadcast of June 3, 1947, the Viceroy had stated: I am of course just as much opposed to the partition of Provinces as I am to the partition of India herself and for the same basic reasons. For just as I feel there is an Indian consciousness which should transcend communal differences, so I feel there is a Punjabi and a Bengali consciousness which has evoked a loyalty to their provinces. And so I felt it was essential that the people of India themselves should decide this question of partition.
