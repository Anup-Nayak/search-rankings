 Some people believe that this movement will collapse like the one against the partition of Bengal. What would you say to this? There are bound to be, among the people, such bubbles which arise and burst. If all the babies born could live, what more could the world ask for? We should embark on this task only after taking our weakness into account. There were two weaknesses in the movement against the partition of Bengal: (1) The students were not made to leave Government schools and (2) the leaders continued to send their own children to colleges and such institutions. These two weaknesses are being overcome to the extent possible. I am always prepared to be cursed by the students. One who wishes to serve the public must, from the very beginning, be prepared for curses. Both the public and I must be prepared to suffer the consequences of this course. That alone will raise the future generations.
